Game Title
"Shadow Circuit"

Concept
"Shadow Circuit" is a fast-paced, neon-drenched cyber-noir stealth game set in a dystopian future where mega-corporations control the city. Players take on the role of a rogue hacker who must infiltrate high-security facilities, outsmart AI surveillance, and uncover corporate secrets.

Gameplay
Players navigate isometric levels filled with guards, cameras, drones, and digital traps. The objective is to collect intel, sabotage systems, and escape undetected. The player can hack devices, cloak themselves temporarily, or use environment-based tactics to mislead enemies. Each level has optional objectives and multiple paths for varied playstyles (stealth, speedrun, or full intel collection).

Unique Features
Real-time dynamic hacking: Pause or slow time to manipulate enemy vision cones, disable drones, or open alternate paths.
Procedurally generated side missions: Randomized layouts and objectives keep gameplay fresh between story missions.
Reputation system: Player actions influence how corporations and factions respond—more aggressive patrols, better loot, or access to underground networks.

Target Audience
Ages 15–35, fans of stealth games, cyberpunk settings, and tactical gameplay. Appeals to players who enjoy games like Mark of the Ninja, Invisible, Inc., or Deus Ex.

Art Style & Theme
Stylized 2.5D isometric art with a high-contrast neon color palette. Heavy cyberpunk influence: rainy cityscapes, glowing advertisements, grim alleys, and hi-tech interiors. Synth-heavy soundtrack sets the mood.

Inspiration
Inspired by classic stealth and hacking games like Invisible, Inc., Metal Gear Solid, and Gunpoint, combined with the aesthetic of Blade Runner and Cyberpunk 2077.

Tools or Platforms
Planned for development in Unity, targeting PC and consoles, with a potential cloud-save companion app for mobile (to manage upgrades, gear, and lore entries).
