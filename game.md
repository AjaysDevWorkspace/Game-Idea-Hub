## Concept

Set in a dark medieval kingdom, players take the role of a young warrior with a mysterious past, bound to finish the journey his blinded master—once the great hero of the land—failed to complete. The game blends brutal sword combat with a deep psychological thriller narrative, where every blade carries secrets and every choice reveals pieces of forgotten lore.

## Gameplay

Players explore ruined castles, cursed villages, and ancient forests while mastering a variety of swords, each with unique power-ups and fighting styles. Combat is skill-based, combining precision swordplay, parries, and magical enhancements drawn from the blades themselves. The objective is to uncover the truth behind the protagonist’s past, confront the forces that blinded his master, and decide whether to follow in his footsteps or carve a new destiny.
