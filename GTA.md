# Game Title
GTA 7

## Concept
I want to create a game which is similar to GTA, but more intractive and free to play open world. In current GTA 5 there is a storyline which you can't change and you have to play according to the missions given. You can't change it i.e. you can't change storyline and have to follow it. I want it to be more humanised and more like a real world with each player playing a unique storyline of their own.

## Gameplay
It is a free to play PC game. Player can take a feel of new world which they can control as they want.

## Unique Features
I am providing such a game for free.

## Target Audience
It is for mainly for teenagers.

## Art Style & Theme
It will look like a real world.

## Inspiration
GTA 5
