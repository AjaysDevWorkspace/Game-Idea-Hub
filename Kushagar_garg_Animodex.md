Animodex

Animodex is an interactive educational game where players classify animals into their correct categories while learning fun facts about them. The goal is to complete the animal index (Animodex) and progress through levels with increasing difficulty.

Players drag and drop animal specimens into the correct categories (mammals, reptiles, amphibians, etc.). A progress bar tracks completion, and wrong placements trigger funny escape animations.

Unique Features:

Engaging drag-and-drop mechanics with instant feedback.

Animals react with expressive emotions when misplaced.

Unlockable levels and achievements as the Animodex fills up.

Blends learning with lighthearted humor.

Target Audience:
School students, casual gamers, and anyone interested in animals and biology.

Art Style and Theme:
Bright, cartoonish 2D art with bold colors and expressive animations. Theme is playful yet informative, balancing fun with learning.

Inspiration:
Inspired by classic educational games like Pok√©dex systems and zoo simulators, with a focus on making biology interactive and memorable.
