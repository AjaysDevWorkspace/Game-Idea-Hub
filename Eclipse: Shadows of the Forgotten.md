# Game Title
Eclipse: Shadows of the Forgotten

## Concept
A story-driven action-adventure game where players explore a fractured world stuck between light and darkness. The player must restore balance by solving puzzles, battling shadow creatures, and uncovering ancient secrets hidden in the ruins of a fallen civilization.

## Gameplay
Players control a lone wanderer with the ability to shift between the realms of light and shadow. Each realm offers unique paths, enemies, and puzzles. The objective is to collect fragments of the lost sun, which together unlock the final gateway to restore balance to the world.

## Unique Features
- **Dual-Realm Mechanic**: Switch between light and shadow realms to solve puzzles and fight enemies that only exist in one world.  
- **Adaptive Storyline**: Choices made in one realm affect the other, leading to multiple endings.  
- **Dynamic Environment**: Time of day changes gameplay—shadows grow stronger at night, while puzzles reveal themselves in daylight.  

## Target Audience
Teens and adults (13+) who enjoy narrative-driven adventures, puzzle-solving, and exploration. Fans of *Zelda*, *Hollow Knight*, and *Ori and the Blind Forest* would find it appealing.

## Art Style & Theme
A hand-painted art style with glowing contrasts—bright, serene landscapes in the light realm and eerie, mysterious visuals in the shadow realm. The tone is mystical, emotional, and immersive.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the dual-world mechanic of *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* and the atmospheric storytelling of *Ori and the Blind Forest*.
